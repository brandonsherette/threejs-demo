#Three JS Example

#Purpose
To demonstrate and experiment with the JavaScript Library, THREE.js and its capablities with 3D Objects.

I will continue adding, updating, and testing features as I come around to it.

This particual project uses a rudimentary style of Component / Module structure that I came up with on the fly that was inspired by various techniques from Angular and Backbone. I wanted to keep outside dependencies to 
a minmal, only utlizing jQuery and Bootstrap, but wanted to keep the project somewhat modular and to showcase some of my own code without the use of my favorite frameworks, Angular and Backbone.

#Installation
Assuming node.js / npm is installed


`npm install`

#Gulp

`gulp serve`

Serves the application in an Express Server.
